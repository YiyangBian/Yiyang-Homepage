abstract: Preparing high-quality datasets for data science models is a critical yet challenging task. Traditional data discovery approaches often focus on a single optimization criterion, which can introduce bias and limit downstream performance. This paper introduces **MODis**, a multi-objective data discovery framework that generates *skyline datasets* tailored to user-defined model performance measures (e.g., accuracy, training cost). MODis formalizes the skyline dataset generation problem using a finite state transducer (FST), and provides three algorithms:(1) a **reduce-from-universal** strategy that prunes unpromising data while approximating Pareto-optimal sets, (2) a **bi-directional search** that interleaves augmentation and reduction with correlation-based pruning, and (3) a **diversification algorithm** to mitigate dataset bias. Experiments with benchmark datasets and scientific applications show that MODis can improve model accuracy by up to 2Ã— while reducing training cost, outperforming baseline data integration and feature selection methods.
