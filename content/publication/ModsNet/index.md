abstract: We demonstrate ModsNet, a search tool for pre-trained data science MODels recommendatioN using Examplar daTaset. Given a set of pre-trained data science models, an ‚Äúexample‚Äù input dataset, and a user-specified performance metric, ModsNet answers the following query "what are top-k models that have the best expected performance for the input data?‚Äù The need for searching high-quality
pre-trained models is evident in data-driven analysis. Inspired by "query by example‚Äù paradigm, ModsNet does not require users to write complex queries, but only provide an "examplar" dataset, a task description, and a performance measure as input, and can automatically suggest top-ùëò matching models that are expected to have desirable performance to perform the task over the provided sample dataset. ModsNet utilizes a knowledge graph to integrate model performances over datasets and synchronizes it with a bipartite graph neural network to estimate model performance, reduce
inference cost, and promptly respond to top-ùëò model search queries. To cope with strict cold-start (upon receiving a new dataset when no historical performance of registered models are observed), it performs a dynamic, cost-bounded ‚Äúprobe-and-select‚Äù strategy to incrementally identify promising models. We demonstrate the application of ModsNet in enabling efficient scientific data analysis.
